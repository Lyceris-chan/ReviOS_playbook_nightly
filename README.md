## FAQ

<details><summary>Why does this fork exist?</summary>

I tried to use the original ReviOS Playbook with the latest Windows Insider builds, but it didn't work. So I decided to fork the original playbook and add support for the latest Windows Insider builds and nightly builds, because, why not?

</details>

<details><summary>What is Windows Insider?</summary>

Windows Insider is an open software testing program by Microsoft that allows users globally to test pre-release versions of the Windows operating system. It is a way to get early access to new features and improvements, but it may also contain bugs and other issues.

</details>

<details><summary>What does nightly build mean?</summary>

Nightly builds are bleeding-edge versions of the playbook. That means that **everything** that is commited to the main repository will be included in the nightly build. This includes untested and potentially broken features!

</details>

<details><summary>What is the difference between the original ReviOS Playbook and this fork?</summary>

This fork is based on the original ReviOS Playbook, but with support for the latest Windows Insider builds and nightly builds.
