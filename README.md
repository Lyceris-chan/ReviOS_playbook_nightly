This is a fork of the original [ReviOS Playbook](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook), with support for the latest Windows Insider builds and nightly builds.

###### Why? I tried to install ReviOS on a Windows 11 Insider build, and it didn't work. So I made this fork to add support for the latest Insider builds

> [!CAUTION]
> The nightly builds are not tested and may not work. **Use at your own risk.**

> [!WARNING]
> ReviOS does not officially support Windows Insider builds. **Use at your own risk.**
